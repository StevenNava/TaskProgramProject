Synopsis
--------
Task Assistant allows users to manage their taks and keep track of their busy lives. Any tasks added through the program are added to a SQL database. Any queries occur using SQL language. Email address settings and others can be changed through the settings menu.

Reasons
-------
This project was created out of a need to keep track of all tasks during a very busy time in my life and it is my hope that it can assist with yours.

Usage Instructsions
-------------------
Using the application is fairly straigtforward and for that reason a separate instructions file was not deemed necessary.


// To Add Tasks //

Hover over the 'Add Tasks' menu button. The 'Add Tasks' menu will appear. Enter all task information here and click 'Submit'. A transaction request will be sent to the SQL database to add the task.

// To Remove Tasks //

Hover over the 'Remove Tasks' menu button. The 'Remove Tasks' menu will appear. Enter all task information that you have and click search. Any tasks matching the required information will populate into a drop-down menu and the task to be removed will need to be selected. Once selected, click remove. Confirm that this is the task that you would like to remove and click OK on the confirmation popup.
